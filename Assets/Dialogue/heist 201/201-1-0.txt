Hello, I am your inside man, and I am helping you make up a plan for your heist.
We are going to execute the heist 2 months later and it's better to plan it now.
Recently we get the latest source code of the AI guards and we are able to simulate their behaviors.
The view you see now is the simulation of their behaviors,
they will behave exactly as you see, unless... you are spotted.
We are now scheduling the attacks to help you get through.
By the time then a virus in their system will trigger those attacks at exactly when and where you deploy them now.
The operations are very simple:
Click on ground to deploy an EMP attack;
Click on transformers to overload them.
Remember: a single noise of overloading transformers will distract at most 2 guards,
and there may be other side effects, like opening a door...
Any advice? Always to observe, think, plan and finally execute.
If you feel like messed up, just replan!
Get ready...
