Alright, let's get down to business.
Let me know exactly when and where you want me to place my attacks, and I can get it done.
I've only got so many I can execute, so use them carefully.
Observe, think, plan and finally execute.
Try and use the waypoints to remind yourself where to go next.
If you feel like messed up, just replan!
Get ready...
