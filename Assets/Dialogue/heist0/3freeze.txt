Here's where having an inside man works to your advantage.
The inside man can place traps for you, as long as you give him a time and a place.
The "freeze trap" can be used to halt a guards movement and daze them for a few seconds.
A "dazed" guard will be unable to detect you.
Use the onscreen controls to have the inside place freeze traps for you.
Make sure to pay attention to the timeline so you know when these traps will trigger.
Press "enter" when you're ready to start the level.
