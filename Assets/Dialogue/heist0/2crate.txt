Sometimes avoiding detection isn't always possible.
However, you can do your best to hide from guards once you've been detected.
In front of you is a crate, which you can enter and exit by pressing "E".
Once inside, guards will no longer be able to detect you.
Use this to your advantage and reach the door on the other side.
Press "enter" when you're ready to start the level.
