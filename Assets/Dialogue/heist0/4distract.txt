The inside man has many different gadgets in his arsenal.
The next tool is the "distraction trap," which causes a loud noise.
Guards are distracted when the trap is activated, and flock to the location of the sound.
Use this to your advantage and clear guards from your path.
Press "enter" when you're ready to start the level.
