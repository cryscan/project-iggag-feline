The inside man has many different gadgets in his arsenal.
The next tool is the "distraction trap," which causes a loud noise.
The speakers are located at the far end of rooms.
You can only place distraction trap at the location of the Speaker.
Guards are distracted when the trap is activated, and flock to the location of the sound.
At most two guards will be sent to check the noise. 
Use this to your advantage and clear guards from your path.
Press "enter" when you're ready to start the level.
