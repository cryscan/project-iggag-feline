So you wanna be a master thief, huh?
Well the first thing you'll have to learn is how to get around guards.
These robot guards are intimidating, but not that smart.
If they spot you in their flashlight they'll begin to notice you.
Once their flashlights turn red they've "detected" you.
With this in mind, try to reach the other side of the level.
Press "enter" when you're ready to start the level.
