You look like you know what you're doing.
You know... I'm getting a team together...
I could use a thief like you, and I've a couple of jobs coming up.
I'm opening the last door to the outside. Either step outside and come find me...
...or rot in a cell for the rest of your life.
Your choice, master thief.
