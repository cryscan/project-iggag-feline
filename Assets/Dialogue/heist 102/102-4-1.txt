We have just scheduled 2 attacks which will overload the transformers inside both rooms.
At most 2 guards will be distracted each time.
This attack will also break the transformers,
so one of the nearby guards will stay there to repair it.
Fact: their software is single-threaded,
they cannot chase or attack you when doing repairing or something else.
Take the chance to get through,
and this time you won't be given a second chance.
