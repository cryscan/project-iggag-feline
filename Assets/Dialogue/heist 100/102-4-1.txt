I've scheduled 2 more attacks which will overload some transformers in the upcoming rooms.
These "Distraction Attacks" will cause 2 of the nearest guards to stop patrolling and run to fix the transformer.
Broken transformers will also cause nearby locked doors to open.
Use these attacks to your advantage and sprint by the bots while they're distracted.
